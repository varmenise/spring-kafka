== What's New in 3.3 Since 3.2
:page-section-summary-toc: 1

This section covers the changes made from version 3.2 to version 3.3.
For changes in earlier version, see xref:appendix/change-history.adoc[Change History].

[[x33-dlt-topic-naming]]
=== DLT Topic Naming Convention

The naming convention for DLT topics has been standardized to use the "-dlt" suffix consistently. This change ensures compatibility and avoids conflicts when transitioning between different retry solutions. Users who wish to retain the ".DLT" suffix behavior need to opt-in explicitly by setting the appropriate DLT name property.

[[x33-seek-with-group-id]]
=== Enhanced Seek Operations for Consumer Groups

A new method, `getGroupId()`, has been added to the `ConsumerSeekCallback` interface.
This method allows for more selective seek operations by targeting only the desired consumer group.
The `AbstractConsumerSeekAware` can also now register, retrieve, and remove all callbacks for each topic partition in a multi-group listener scenario without missing any.
See the new APIs (`getSeekCallbacksFor(TopicPartition topicPartition)`, `getTopicsAndCallbacks()`) for more details.
For more details, see xref:kafka/seek.adoc#seek[Seek API Docs].

[[x33-new-option-ignore-empty-batch]]
=== Configurable Handling of Empty Batches in Kafka Listener with RecordFilterStrategy

`RecordFilterStrategy` now supports ignoring empty batches that result from filtering.
This can be configured through overriding default method `ignoreEmptyBatch()`, which defaults to false, ensuring `KafkaListener` is invoked even if all `ConsumerRecords` are filtered out.
For more details, see xref:kafka/receiving-messages/filtering.adoc[Message receive filtering Docs].
